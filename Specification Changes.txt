Change 1:
We took the struct ConfigurationParams defined in SocialClusteringService.hpp out of the file and put it into its own file. Moreover we added a managing utiltiy for it which is a proxy for the structure. Additionally we added the ability to load a configuration from a file.

Change 2: 
We changed the folder structure of the project from having multiple subfolders in a src directory to a more stream lined and common model. We have now a folder include, which includes all the header files. All source files are added to the folder src and we will build the project always in the folder build, which only exist on our dev machines and will not be committed.
